This Repository tracks our learning experiences.

The Aim of this project will be to use a SLAM Algorithm to map and navigate in an indoor environment . The environment will be a simulated one and will be imported from gazebo model Library. The task of the bot is to detect a person/object which will be spawned in the environment using Object Detection and follow it in the indoor environment avoiding all the obstacles using SLAM. We will use an automatic mapping technique which is relatively quite a new and useful technique.
