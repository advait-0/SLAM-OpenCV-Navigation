## Cross product
<p> What is a cross product in terms of vectors? </p>
<p> The area enclosed by two vectors such that a paralleogram is made using lines parallel to the 2 vectors.</p>

#### What does it mean in terms of a vector?
<p> There exists a vector which has magnitude equal to the area enclosed by them and direction perpendicular to the two 3-D vectors.</p>

### Determinant
The determinant also gives the area enclosed by two vectors. Hence, the magnitude of the cross product and the determinant is same. 

### When is the value of cross product maximum?
Maximum area is enclosed when the two vectors are placed at 90 deg, forming a square. However, as the angle between the two vectots decreases, the shape formed is a rhombus which has a smaller area.

### Scaling one of the vectors
(3 v) x (w)= 3(v x w)

## Basis Vectors
What are basis vectors?
<p>They are like reference unit vectors linear combinations of whixh are used to represent different vectors.</p>
